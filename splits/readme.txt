This file contain the train-test split in the three considered mode:
- Canonical
- Augmented
- Transfer settings
For canonical and augmented settings, we randomly divided the dataset into 5 splits. In the canonical setting, 80% of the dataset was used for training, 
and the remaining 20% was used for evaluation. However, in the augmented setting, 80% of the dataset augmented with another three datasets was used for 
training. In the transfer setting, three datasets were used for training and the remaining one dataset was used for evaluation.
